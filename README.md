# AI Job Matching & Recommendation System

An AI-powered job recommendation system that analyzes a candidate's resume and intelligently matches it with relevant job opportunities using Natural Language Processing (NLP), semantic embeddings, and explainable compatibility analysis.

## Overview

Modern job portals rely heavily on keyword search, often producing irrelevant results.  
This project introduces an intelligent recommendation system that understands resumes and job descriptions semantically and ranks opportunities based on real compatibility rather than keyword overlap.

The system acts as an AI-driven recruitment assistant capable of identifying suitable jobs while explaining *why* a recommendation is made.
